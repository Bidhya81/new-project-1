 Cooking with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is all about AI'S capability to personalize and innovatte in cooking but also contribute to smarter kitchen operations and healthier eating habits, which symboisis kitchen into smart environment where meal preparation is assisted by intelligent system.


## Background
My personal motivation for cooking with AI seems to be connected to my intrest in AI as a learning tool and content creation activites. I have researched Ai learning tools to make a content and cooking related videos for yooutube and suggesst a motivation to blend AI technology with cooking as away to educate, inspire and create engaging content, possible making cooking more accessible, innovative or fun using AI.
1.Cooking with AI primarily solved the problrm of making meal preparation easier, more pesonalized and less time consuming amid busy lifestyle.
2.Cooking skill vary widely, and beginners often lack confidence and knowlwdge.
3.food waste is significant issue, with household frequently discarding unused ingridients.
The topic of cooking with AI I found intresting because AI blends technology with culinary art to create a smart kitchen that adapts to individual cooking styles, dietery needs and lifestyle preferences, making cooking fun, accessible, enjoyableand innovative.




## How is it used?
The process of using an AI assistant is typically follows the steps like:
choosing input for our receipe preferences, like, chicken curry , cooking time, dietery restrictions, and available ingredients. It may adapt the receipe according to our kitchen tools and appliances.provides real time step by step cooking  cues through voice command or app notifications.It monitor and adjust cooking time in real time by avoiding over or undercooking. AI can offer the plating tips for side dish. This approach turns cooking an interactive guided experience, making it easier and faster.
Users of AI in cooking include a board range of people such as home cooks, prpofessional chefs, food business and cloud kitchen users.
Kinds of needs to be taken into account for users of cooking with AI are: planning guidance through receipe and cooking assistance, professionals chefs needs AI tools for receipe innovation and workflow optimization,food business using AI for trend analysis, menu personalization, smart or cloud kitchen using AI for automated cooking, and real time cooking fedback.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |


Challenges of cooking with AI is that the system cannot actually taste or smell food. so flavour adjustment is difficult.Another challenge is handling data from different
cuisines and formats. In future this project may grow by adding more detailed receipe including real time  feedback.
The project does not gurantee perfect or personalised receipe for every users taste.
It does not handle nutritional accuracy.It cannot taste or adjust seasoning. It does not solve the problem of availability.


How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
In the future, this prpoject could suggest personalized recipes based on users preferences and dietery needs.
It could alsp provide notritional information and ingredient substitution.
The system might connect with smart kitchen devices to give step by step cooking guidance.
